# Pressure Tap Board Library
I wrote this library for [Cal Poly Space Systems](https://github.com/CalPolySpaceSystems), the rocketry club on campus. In this project, I programmed the pressure tap board to retrieve and store pressure data for six pressure sensors. Each sensor was attached to a tube that would be routed to a specific location on our rocket.

I am always trying to learn from my mistakes, so please [provide feedback or suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/BenClark1/ptap_ads1115/issues). Your input is much appreciated.
